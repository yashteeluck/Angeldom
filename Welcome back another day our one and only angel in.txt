Welcome back another day our one and only angel in this virtual world designed for our only angel. I want to come forward and express my utmost appreciation towards her and tell her that I recognise her worth, her authenticity, her kindness just everything about her. She makes everything absolutely beautiful. 

When we talk about the wonders of the world, now that I have met you there are not 7 wonders of the world, but there are 8. Colossus of Rhodes. If you don’t know let me tell you. There is the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, The Lighthouse of Alexandria, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, the Statue of Zeus at Olympia, the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus and finally there is Anshee. In other words a synonym for Anshee is God’s gift. She is truly a work of art crafted individually from the hands of the almighty. 

Many people travel from different corners around the globe to visit the 7 wonders of the world. But for me, god gifted me the 8th wonder which was missing which the world did not see, And of course I will make sure that I maintain my wonder and that I always do my best to protect my wonder and make her feel safe secured and reassured. 

Thank god to have given me this wonder and I feel very grateful that I did not have to spend money to visit whatever wonder there is in the world. And in addition, god gave me the most wonderful one and the best wonder that there may be in this entire universe.

I thank god for his gift and for his wonder. I will cherish that wonder and I will do my best to keep the wonder he gave me always wonderful.
