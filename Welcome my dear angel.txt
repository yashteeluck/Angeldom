Welcome my dear angel, I am getting pretty much burnt out writing the paragraphs for you after building our project. It has not been easy. But, my love for you is giving me all the strength I need to make this for you.

I want to tell you about my perspective today. So, after our big fight, I knew deep down that I have to give the best of what I have deep down inside of my heart I have to give this relationship my all. I have a lot a lot and a lot of anger issues. I have it inside of me. And I know that I get pissed off very easily and this at times hurt you.

That’s when I said to myself that I have to prove not by words but by my actions this time that I am going to be willing to do anything that will reassure you that I was I am and I shall always be yours and yours only. I am not perfect but I can say with 100% conviction that I am willing to do whatever I can in my power to make sure now that you never lack the love and affection you always wanted in your life. 

All of these that you are seeing are not mere words but what I genuinely feel deep down inside of my heart. For what I have done right now for you, this is not just to make you fooled. I have realised that I need to give you lots of reassurance and I have decided to focused on the love language words of affirmation cause I know you love that language. So, that is why I have decided to do this thing for you. I swear building this has not been easy and I can guarantee you that later I will do another thing for you better and I will improve it. 

Don’t worry my love, when I held your hand in front of god and told that I love you, I never lied. I realised that in a relationship it is not about finding the right person but making yourself the right person for the one you love. 

Just give me 1% of what you have and I promise you that I will give you more than you ever realized a guy can give.
