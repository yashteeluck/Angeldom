Glad to have seen you again. One must say with absolute conviction that there is no one, absolutely no one like you. Not even 1%, not even 1%. In fact not even less than 1%. Ohhh what the hell. My maths is bad anyways. Not even less than 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001%. One should always remain stupid in fact an absolute idiot, the dumbest of the dumbest about how trying to find a dust particle among all the substances, all the matter present in this huge humongous planet. 
A person like you is enough to light up the world of the whole world. You possess immense amount of light, immense amount of energy, vibes, to lighten up a whole universe. If you are one day sent up to space, there will be another sun and the moon will shine 50% more brighter and it may be possible that the Eid Festival may be celebrated one month in advance as they will be able to see the moon more in advance. Moreover, thank God that you are not up there in space I wonder what would have happened. People with fair skin would become black and black people would become coal. Complete ashes.
It is good that you are present on the Earth and that you are here among us humans. Instead of emitting huge amounts of light, you are emitting great positive vibes. When we look at the Universe It is undeniable that there is only one is such a vast number of people residing in this earth to have only one like you.

Anyways, have a very great day and keep smiling as always and keep the wire drawn smile on your face maintain that big smile and that big great huge worth of yours.
